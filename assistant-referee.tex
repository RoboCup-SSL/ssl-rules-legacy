\section{The Assistant Referee}\label{sec:assistant-referee}

\subsection{Duties}
The assistant referee is appointed whose duties, subject to the decision of the referee, are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item act as timekeeper and keep a record of the match
\item to operate the communications equipment to relay the referee's signals over the communications links
\item monitor the robot operators for illegal signals being sent to the robots
\item indicate when an interchange is requested
\item indicate when misconduct or any other incident has occurred out of the view of the referee
\item indicate when offences have been committed whenever the assistants are closer to the action than the referee (this includes, in particular circumstances, offences committed in the defence area)
\item indicate whether, at penalty kicks, the goalkeeper has moved forward before the ball has been kicked and if the ball has crossed the line
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assistance}
The assistant referees also assist the referee to control the match in accordance with the Laws of the Game.
In the event of undue interference or improper conduct, the referee will relieve an assistant referee of his duties and make a report to the organising committee.
