\section{The Ball In and Out of Play}\label{sec:ball-in-and-out-of-play}

\subsection{Ball Out of Play}
The ball is out of play when:
\begin{itemize}
\item it has wholly crossed the goal boundary or touch boundary whether on the ground or in the air
\item play has been stopped by a signal from the referee
\end{itemize}

When the ball goes out of play, robots should remain 500\,mm from the ball as the ball is placed until the restart signal is given by the referee.

\subsection{Ball In Play}
The ball is in play at all other times.

\subsection{Infringements/Sanctions}
If, at the time the ball enters play, a member of the kicker's team occupies the area closer than 200\,mm to the opponent's defence area:
\begin{itemize}
\item an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team, the kick to be taken from the location of the ball when the infringement occurred (see \autoref{sec:free-kicks})
\end{itemize}

If, after the ball enters play other than due to a forced restart, the kicker touches the ball a second time (without holding the ball) before it has touched another robot:
\begin{itemize}
\item an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team, the kick to be taken from the place where the infringement occurred (see \autoref{sec:free-kicks})
\end{itemize}

If, after the ball enters play other than due to a forced restart, the kicker deliberately holds the ball before it has touched another robot:
\begin{itemize}
\item a direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team, the kick to be taken from the place where the infringement occurred (see \autoref{sec:free-kicks})
\end{itemize}

If, after a signal to restart play is given, the ball does not enter play within 10 seconds or lack of progress clearly indicates that the ball will not enter play within 10 seconds:
\begin{itemize}
\item the play is stopped by a signal from the referee,
\item all robots have to move 500\,mm from the ball
\item a forced restart is indicated, and
\item once the referee indicates the forced restart, robots from either team may approach and touch the ball
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
For all restarts where the Laws stipulate that the ball is in play when it is kicked and moves, the robot must clearly tap or kick the ball to make it move.
It is understood that the ball may remain in contact with the robot or be bumped by the robot multiple times over a short distance while the kick is being taken, but under no circumstances should the robot remain in contact or touch the ball after it has traveled 50\,mm, unless the ball has previously touched another robot.
Robots may use dribbling and kicking devices in taking the free kick.

\item
The exclusion zone closer than 200\,mm to the opponent's defence area during restarts is designed to allow defending teams to position a defence against a kick without interference from the opponents.
This change was added to help teams defend against corner kicks in which teams use elevated ``chip kick'' passes directly into the defence area.
\end{enumerate}
