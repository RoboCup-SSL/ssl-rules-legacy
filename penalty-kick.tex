\section{The Penalty Kick}\label{sec:penalty-kick}

A penalty kick is awarded against a team which commits one of the five offences for which a direct free kick is awarded, inside its own defence area and while the ball is in play.

A goal may be scored directly from a penalty kick.

Additional time is allowed for a penalty kick to be taken at the end of each half or at the end of periods of extra time.

\subsection{Position of the Ball and the Robots}
The ball:

\begin{itemize}
\item is placed on the penalty mark
\end{itemize}

The robot taking the penalty kick:

\begin{itemize}
\item is properly identified
\end{itemize}

The defending goalkeeper:

\begin{itemize}
\item remains between the goalposts, touches its goal line, and faces outward of the goal, until the ball has been kicked\removed{. I}\added{; i}t is allowed to move before the ball has been kicked, as long as its motion does not break any of these constraints\removed{.}
\end{itemize}

The robots other than the kicker are located:

\begin{itemize}
\item inside the field of play
\item behind a line parallel to the goal line and 400\added{\,}mm behind the penalty mark
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Referee}
\begin{itemize}
\item does not signal for a penalty kick to be taken until the robots have taken up position in accordance with the Law
\item decides when a penalty kick has been completed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item the robot taking the penalty kicks the ball forward
\item it does not play the ball a second time until it has touched another robot
\item the ball is in play when it is kicked and moves forward
\end{itemize}

When a penalty kick is taken during the normal course of play, or time has been extended at half-time or full time to allow a penalty kick to be taken or retaken, a goal is awarded if, before passing between the goalposts and under the crossbar:

\begin{itemize}
\item the ball touches either or both of the goalposts and/or the crossbar, and/or the goalkeeper
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Infringements/Sanctions}
\textit{If the referee gives the signal for a penalty kick to be taken and, before the ball is in play, one of the following situations occurs:}

The robot taking the penalty kick infringes the Laws of the Game:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to proceed
\item if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is not retaken
\end{itemize}

The goalkeeper infringes the Laws of the Game:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to proceed
\item if the ball enters the goal, a goal is awarded
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is retaken
\end{itemize}

A team-mate of the robot taking the kick enters the area 400\,mm behind the penalty mark:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to proceed
\item if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is not retaken
\item if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper, the crossbar or the goal post and is touched by this robot, the referee stops play and restarts the match with an indirect free kick to the defending team
\end{itemize}

A team-mate of the goalkeeper enters the area 400\,mm behind the penalty mark:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to proceed
\item if the ball enters the goal, a goal is awarded
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is retaken
\end{itemize}

A robot of both the defending team and the attacking team infringe the Laws of the Game:

\begin{itemize}
\item the kick is retaken
\end{itemize}

\textit{If, after the penalty kick has been taken:}

Any infringement as listed in \autoref{sec:ball-in-and-out-of-play} is handled accordingly\added{.}

The ball is touched by an outside agent as it moves forward:

\begin{itemize}
\item the kick is retaken
\end{itemize}

The ball rebounds into the field of play from the goalkeeper, the crossbar or the goalposts, and is then touched by an outside agent:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee stops play
\item play is restarted with a dropped ball at the place where it touched the outside agent (see \autoref{sec:free-kicks})
\end{itemize}
